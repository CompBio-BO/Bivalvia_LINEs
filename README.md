# Bivalvia_LINEs
Collection of manually curated LINE consensus sequences extracted from Bivalvia genomes

### Format:

```<SPECIES NAME>_<PROGRESSIVE NUMBER>_cons_<AUT|RVT>#<RepeatMasker classification> <LINE CLADE> <ALIGNMENT SIZE>```  
*e.g:* A.i.concentricus_9_cons_AUT#LINE/CR1-Zenon CR1 7

AUT=Consensus sequence with both RVT and EN domain.  
RVT=Consensus sequence missing the RVT domain.  
ALIGNMENT SIZE=Number of sequences used to generate the consensus sequences.  

Consensus sequences construction workflow:  
1.
