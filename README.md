# Bivalvia_LINEs
Manually curated LINE consensus sequences extracted from Bivalvia genomes

### Format:

<SPECIES NAME>_<PROGRESSIVE NUMBER>_cons_<AUT|RVT>#<RepeatMasker classification> <LINE CLADE> <ALIGNMENT SIZE>

AUT=Consensus sequence with both RVT and EN domain
RVT=Consensus sequence missing the RVT domain
ALIGNMENT SIZE=Number of sequences used to generate the consensus sequences.

Consensus sequences construction workflow:
1.
